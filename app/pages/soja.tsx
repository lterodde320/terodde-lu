          Addrest was born out of frustration. I was working for a startup that
          was handling addresses in a very casual manner. With too many things
          to do and not many people working at the company, the problem
          wasn&apos;t taken very seriously. Over time, the company showed great
          success, hiring more and more people, entering more and more data.
          <br />
          The first signs of data inconsistency started to appear: the marketing
          department wanted to start a new marketing campaign. The idea was to
          send a postcard to leads with specific zip-codes.

          Throughout my career, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to work on a
          diverse range of software projectsâ€”both contracted and personal. Each
          project has been a new challenge, pushing me to expand my skills and
          deliver solutions that make a difference.
          <br />
          I have a quality-driven approach, always striving to deliver the best
          possible product in a given time frame. The user experience is at the
          heart of everything I do. Staying up to date with the latest
          technologies and best practices is crucial
          <br />
          Whether I&apos;m writing code or producing music, I strive to create
          work that resonates and leaves a lasting impact. Thank you for
          visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you!
