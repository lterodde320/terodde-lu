                    Addrest was born out of frustration. I was working for a startup that
                    was handling addresses in a very casual manner. With too many things to do and not many
                    people working at the company, the problem wasn&apos;t taken very seriously. Over time, 
                    the company showed great success, hiring more and more people, entering more and more data.
                    <br />
                    The first signs of data inconsistency started to appear: the marketing department wanted to 
                    start a new marketing campaign. The idea was to send a postcard to leads with specific zip-codes.

                    Throughout my career, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to work on a diverse
                    range of software projectsâ€”both contracted and personal. Each project
                    has been a new challenge, pushing me to expand my skills and deliver
                    solutions that make a difference.

                    I have a quality-driven approach, always striving to deliver the best possible product in a given time frame.
                    The user experience is at the heart of everything I do. Staying up to date with the latest technologies and
                    best practices is crucial

                    Whether I&apos;m writing code or producing music, I strive to create work
                    that resonates and leaves a lasting impact. Thank you for visiting my
